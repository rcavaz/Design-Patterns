### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

#### Motivation

It often happens that a request/event generated by one object needs to be handled by a potentially variable number of other objects and hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence, or request-to-handler mappings is not an option.

The Chain of Responsibility design pattern allows an object to send a command, without knowing what object will receive and handle it, through a pipeline or chain of handlers.

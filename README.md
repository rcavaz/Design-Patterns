# Design-Patterns
A collection of software design patterns.

## [Creational](./creational/README.md)
Pattern | Intent
:-----: | ------
Singleton | Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
Factory Method | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Abstract Factory | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Prototype | Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Builder | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
